## Overview

This automated solution enables customers to leverage public open source repositories to train more robust customizations with Amazon Q Customizations. By orchestrating the process of detecting, downloading, and preparing new repository releases, this architecture provides seamless access to a wealth of up-to-date training data. Customers can focus on configuring the repositories they want to pull from instead of building complex workflows for sourcing public data. The event-driven automation checks for the latest releases and makes extracted assets readily available in Amazon S3 for training customizations. Rather than being limited to private repositories connected through CodeStar, customers can now tap into public open source code at scale to create inline code suggestions finely tuned to their needs, drawing on the most current repositories. This architecture unlocks the full potential of Q Customizations by enabling customers to leverage public data and achieve customizations with greater relevance powered by the most recent code.

### Architecture

![reference architecture](assets/images/creating-a-customized-coding-companion-with-amazon-q-developer.png)

### Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of October 2023, the cost for running this Guidance with the default settings in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region is approximately **$17 per month**, using the following assumptions:

- 20 repositories checked every 60 minutes
- The size of repository releases average 50MB each
- SNS notifications sent to 10 subscribers

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

This Guidance is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

### Third-party tools

- [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html)
- TypeScript 3.8 or later (```npm -g install typescript```)
- [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (optional)

### AWS CDK bootstrap

This Guidance uses AWS CDK. Bootstrapping is the process of provisioning resources for the AWS CDK before you can deploy AWS CDK apps into an AWS environment (an AWS environment is a combination of an AWS account and Region). If you are using AWS CDK for the first time in an AWS environment, please run the following bootstrapping command:

```cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION```

For additional information or customizations with AWS CDK bootstrapping, see [Bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) in the AWS CDK documentation.

### Supported Regions

Q Customizations is currently hosted in `us-east-1` (the US East (N. Virginia) Region). To support Amazon Q Customizations using Amazon S3, this Guidance must also be deployed in `us-east-1` (the US East (N. Virginia) Region).

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Amazon CodeCatalyst blueprint

1. Create a new project in Amazon CodeCatalyst
2. Select **Start with a blueprint** and choose the **Customized Coding Companion with Amazon Q Customizations** blueprint. Click **Next**.
3. Give your project a name.
4. Select an **AWS account**, **IAM Role**, and **AWS Region**. Optionally configure settings under **Additional configuration options**.
5. Click **Create project**.
 
### Option 2: Manually deploy CDK application

1. Clone the repo using command ```git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-custom-ai-code-generator-on-aws.git```
2. Change the current directory to the repo folder using command ```cd guidance-for-custom-ai-code-generator-on-aws```
3. Install required packages in using command ```npm install```
4. Change the current directory to the `source` folder using command ```cd source```
5. Edit the following attribute values in **cdk.json**:

> **NOTE:**
> Customers are responsible for making their own independent assessment regarding the repositories they choose to include in the deployment of this code sample. Customers should be aware of the license for each repository they include in the deployment, and ensure they are adhering to those license restrictions.

| Attribute value  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `public_github_repos`  | array of the repositories you'd like to include in Amazon Q Customizations. The string format is `GITHUB_ORG/REPOSITORY_NAME` |
| `bucket_name_prefix` | The prefix of the Amazon S3 bucket name to be created  |
| `bucket_removal_policy` | The removal policy of the Amazon S3 bucket name to be created. Should be `DESTROY` or `RETAIN``.  |
| `stack_name` | The name of the AWS CloudFormation Stack to be created  |
| `update_interval_minutes` | The interval (minutes) in which this process will run on a recurring basis  |

6. Deploy the stack using the command ```cdk deploy``` 
7. Enter `y` when prompted with the question, ```Do you wish to deploy these changes (y/n)?```

## Deployment Validation

To validate deployment, use one or more of the following methods:

- From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) in your web browser, open the CloudFormation console, click **Stacks** on the left-hand menu, and verify the stack with the name `<STACK_NAME>` has a status of **CREATE_COMPLETE**. After clicking the stack name, click the Outputs tab and take note of the `RepositoryBucket` value.
- If AWS CLI is installed, run the following command to validate the deployment has a status of **CREATE_COMPLETE**, and take note of the `RepositoryBucket` output value: 
    
    ```aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <STACK_NAME>```

## Running the Guidance

### Observe repository table in Amazon DynamoDB

1. From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) in your web browser, open the Amazon DynamoDB console and click **Tables** on the left-hand menu.

2. Select the table starting with the prefix `CustomAiCodeGenerator`, and click **Explore table items**.

3. Observe the repositories you have configured for downloading/extraction into Amazon S3. Attributes include `id`, `enabled`, `ignore_file_s3_url`, `modified`, and `version`.

![Repository table](assets/images/table.png)

### Observe Amazon S3 bucket contents

1. From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) in your web browser, open the Amazon S3 console.
2. Click the S3 bucket starting with the name observed from the previous step.
3. Observe the contents of the bucket. The latest versions of configured repositories are stored in the `current/` prefix. Older versions that have been replaced are relocated under the `archived/` prefix.

Alternatively, if AWS CLI is installed, run the following command to observe bucket contents: 
    
```aws s3 ls s3://<BUCKET_NAME>```


### Create an Amazon Q Developer customization

1. From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) in your web browser, open the Amazon Q Developer console, and click 'Customizations' in the left-hand menu.

2. Click **Create customization**

![Customizations](assets/images/customizations.png)

3. Enter a Customization name and description.
4. For Source Provider, select **Amazon S3**, and enter the following S3 URI using the bucket name from the previous steps: `s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/current/`
5. Click **Create customization**

## Next Steps

### Adding additional repositories 

1. To include additional repositories for downloading/extraction into Amazon S3, add new strings to the ```public_github_repos``` array attribute in **cdk.json**.
2. Re-deploy the CDK application (manually with `cdk deploy`, or pushing a new commit to your CodeCatalyst repository, which will trigger a deployment).

### Removing/disabling repositories

1. To include additional repositories for downloading/extraction into Amazon S3, remove the repository strings(s) from the ```public_github_repos``` array attribute in **cdk.json**.
2. Re-deploy the CDK application (manually with `cdk deploy`, or pushing a new commit to your CodeCatalyst repository, which will trigger a deployment).

### Configuring update interval

1. To configure the recurring interval (in minutes) for which the AWS Step Functions state machine is triggered, update the ```update_interval_minutes``` string attribute in **cdk.json** (60 is default).
2. Re-deploy the CDK application (manually with `cdk deploy`, or pushing a new commit to your CodeCatalyst repository, which will trigger a deployment).

## Cleanup

To delete and cleanup deployed resources, use one of the following methods:

- To cleanup with AWS CDK:
    - If not currently in the `source` directory, run the command ```cd source```
    - Run the command ```cdk destroy```
    - Enter `y` when prompted ```Are you sure you want to delete: CustomAiCodeGeneratorStack (y/n)?```.
- From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) in your web browser, open the CloudFormation console, click **Stacks** on the left-hand menu, select the stack with the name **CustomAiCodeGeneratorStack**, and click **Delete**.
- If AWS CLI is installed, run the following command: 
    

    ```aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CustomAiCodeGeneratorStack```
